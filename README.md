## FASTQ

An example FASTQ file was generated by taking the first 100 records (head -n 400) of the FASTQ file from sample Col0_C1 of [this experiment](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3279). This is a dataset of the Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia 0 (the reference). The original dataset can be downloaded through the ftp of SRA [(1.6 GB)]( ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754084/ERR754084_1.fastq.gz).

## Alignment files

A subset of the reads aligning to the first 100kb of the chromosome 1 of from sample Col0_C1 of experiment [MTAB-3279](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3279) has been uploaded to figshare: [SAM](http://figshare.com/articles/Example_SAM_file/1460716), [BAM](http://figshare.com/articles/Example_BAM_file/1460736), [BAI](http://figshare.com/articles/Example_BAI_file/1460735).
